                    <p class="lens-intro">I have been a very strong tech partner for the client and have lead multiple successful campaigns. I've built an excellent rapport with Gilead Commercial client and helped them achieve their ambitious missions. Here are some of the reflections:</p>

                    <div class="lens-project">
                        <h4><strong>Gilead Commercial - Cost Optimization</strong></h4>
                        <p>Gilead commercial data estate were bleeding money for their cloud runs and engaged Thoughtworks for helping contain cost spill and enable cost reduction. During the initiative, I led the team to help reduce their monthly cloud spend by 50% and helped save ~3M yearly cloud spend.</p>
                        
                        <h4><strong>Achievement</strong></h4>
                        <p>Client has appreciated the cost optimization work, which helped them enable more innovative solutions to be deployed at a lower TCO. Along with the delivery, this was building my rapport and establishing trust with the client. We also helped client with the walk phase of Finops enablement by using AWS cost utilization raw data and helped build a cost visibility dashboard which enabled them view cost in near realtime and track and contain spikes in cost.</p>
                        
                        <p>Having gained the trust of the client I was given the opportunity to help client with setting MLOps practice for commercial along side good data scientists and ML engineers.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="lens-project">
                        <h4><strong>MLOps - Kite Commercial</strong></h4>
                        <p><strong>Tasks to which I contributed:</strong> I took care of the code refactoring along side ML engineers Sahger Lad and Giulia Falcao and helped create a solution to enable easier deployment of code for ML Models.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Achievement:</strong> Helped team follow sensible defaults for coding practice and Gilead IT penetration in Kite commercial business.</p>

                    <div class="lens-project">
                        <h4><strong>Cross TA GenAI data analysis solution</strong></h4>
                        <p><strong>Problem/Challenge:</strong> With LLM enablement, Gilead commercial had multiple POCs done on text to SQL data analysis and bring your own data file research assistant. However, most of the solutions had fixed set of prompts and only had option to cater to limited set of business users. Maintainability of the solution was also difficult because of many different points of failure and absence of coding best practices in terms of LLM based Gen AI apps.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> To help Gilead Commercial, I propose a solution pairing with Rahul Chaturvedi who works as an Architect from Gilead IT, to create a solution which would be more agentic and allow for configuration of instructions of agents from UI by an SME. The solution currently has been accepted and Gilead has given work to Thoughtworks to help solution the product.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Achievement:</strong> This would enable deployment of Gen AI enabled data assistant for multiple Therapy areas without a lot of changes to code and also help more federated solution deployment with configurable instruction set.</p>

                        <h4><strong>Achievement</strong></h4>
                        <p>The POC was demo'ed to client and basis POC, Thoughtworks was awarded the project.</p>

I can rely on him in contingencies and the throughput at which Sristi delivers speckless solutions is a huge value add for me. I’d even say, It’s Sristi who’s raising the bar overall in multiple areas of engagement. I wanted to list some projects where I think he added a lot of value in stealth mode:

                                Multiple GenAI related initiatives, frameworks and thought leadership
                                Cost Dashboards

I've worked with spark, airflow, soda, python, sql, rust and cloud services like AWS EMR, S3, Athena, Glue, EKS, MWAA, ECR, ALB, Databricks, Snowflake, Redshift.

The dataset was in a raw format and documentation around the data was not readiliy available from AWS as well. I worked on analyzing data and matching the numbers with AWS monthly bills retrospectively for multiple previous months and setup a Tableau dashboard at differnt grain to help easily slide and dice cost data for easier cost tracking and catching any cost spikes related pipelines early to take on ncessary and corrective action.</p>

This needed a end to end trace of model thinking and understanding of what each step in the LLM calls entails and what are request and responses from LLM model to exmplain the thinking behind the model. I worked on exploring Dynatrace as a product with use of OpenLLMetry and OpenTelemetry for enabling full stack tracing of apps.</p>

                                Situation:
                                Kite Commercial MLOps pipeline was facing an issue where certain tasks were taking too long to complete and were requiring larger Databricks clusters to handle the workload. This inefficiency was impacting overall performance and cost.

                                Given Sristi's deep expertise as a Data Engineer and in Spark, he was tasked with optimizing the Databricks notebooks while converting them to python scripts to ensure they made full use of Spark's capabilities. This also involved optimizing the underlying code to enhance performance and reduce the need for larger clusters."</p>

I can rely on him in contingencies and the throughput at which Sristi delivers speckless solutions is a huge value add for me. I’d even say, It’s Sristi who’s raising the bar overall in multiple areas of engagement. I wanted to list some projects where I think he added a lot of value in stealth mode:

 

                                MLOps: A lot of code optimization related metrics have been called out which can be attributed to Sristi’s efforts
                                Multiple GenAI related initiatives, frameworks and thought leadership
                                Cost Dashboards
                                Observability tools analysis
                                Lead in Gpro related development
